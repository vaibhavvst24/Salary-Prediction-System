# Salary Prediction System

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on classifying salary levels based on various input features using supervised machine learning techniques. 
Multiple classification models are implemented and compared to determine the most effective method for predicting salary categories.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

The goal is to predict whether a person's salary falls into a particular category based on features such as age, education, experience, and more. This problem is treated as a classification task.

## 📂 Dataset

Source: Salary Data.csv
